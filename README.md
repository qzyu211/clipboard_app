# Clipboard app
This is a repo for a Clipboard app. The app allows users to add named entries into a database which comes back to users as a table. Entries to the table can be added/updated/deleted, and additionally there is a copy-to-clipboard button. This is the key feature of the app that makes it convenient for users to copy the same items repeatedly from a clipboard.

It is largely inspired from an introductory Flask app tutorial by FreeCodeCamp. It adapts this basic database to incorporate a button that copies content cells to a clipboard via the click of the mouse.
